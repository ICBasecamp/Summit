Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) uses AI across its cloud services, productivity tools, and business solutions to enhance automation, security, and user experience. Its AI initiatives include intelligent cloud services, AI-driven applications for business operations, and advanced capabilities in language processing and cloud computing.
Omidia, a technology consultancy estimates that Microsoft purchased 485,000 of Nvidia's Hopper GPUs in 2024, as reported by Financial Times. The company significantly outpaced rivals like Meta, which bought 224,000, and Chinese companies ByteDance and Tencent, each acquiring around 230,000 units. The demand for Nvidia chips surged as Big Tech invested billions in AI infrastructure to stay competitive.
Microsoft’s investment in Nvidia chips more than tripled from 2023, driven by its AI services and Azure cloud platform, which supports OpenAI and other clients, the report stated. Despite Nvidia’s dominance, the rise of custom AI chips and concerns about slower growth and U.S.-China trade restrictions have tempered its stock performance. Omdia estimates that 43% of server spending in 2024 went to Nvidia, reflecting peak demand.

Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market.
Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year.
Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely.
He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely.
The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence.

Recently, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with Accenture and Avanade to help businesses transform their functions using artificial intelligence and Microsoft Copilot. In addition to that, the company also launched new and improved adapted AI models for various industries, addressing the particular AI needs of organizations.
Speaking of MSFT’s position on AI, on November 19, the company reported on the global impact of its artificial intelligence applications. According to the report, more than 85% of the companies in the Fortune 500 are now using Microsoft AI and almost 70% are using Microsoft 365 Copilot. Overall, the company saw widespread adoption of its AI tools and products by prominent names across the globe. These partnerships and advancements helped Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) report solid financial results, giving it a strong head start to the fiscal year 2025.
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is showing solid performance in the AI domain. On October 31, RBC Capital Markets software equity analyst, Rishi Jaluria, appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss the competitive position of MSFT in the AI sector. Jularia suggested that while the overall business is accelerating, Azure AI has been performing exceptionally, which in his opinion is very encouraging. He also added that despite the hefty capital expenditure, MSFT is in an “enviable” competitive position.
Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:
“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.”
Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

No title found,"Leadership is critical for companies operating in today’s competitive market. The success of these firms relies heavily on the strategy taken, the clarity of messaging, and the morale of the team involved to drive progress. However, the sudden departure of key leaders, like MongoDB’s (MDB) CFO, can be disastrous, and for that reason, I’m bearish on the database giant. While the fundamentals of the business are unchanged and fairly positive in some areas, I see a few red flags for new potential investors.

The company sits in an uncertain place at present. The AI data sector is probably one of the most lucrative and dynamic sectors of the market these days. MongoDB operates in the space as a leader in non-relational database solutions, managing data formats across text, video, and more to support businesses. This sounds complex, but it really just involves storing and using company data in a secure, useful, and organized way for analysis and improved customer experiences.
MongoDB’s Atlas system has been essential for customers in managing this evolving data landscape. A massive 68% of company revenues come from this single product, and despite this impressive feat, the share price has had a disappointing year. Down over 35% in 2024 alone, investors have suffered amid increased competition.
Although I am bearish on MDB, the most recent earnings report has shown plenty of encouraging signs. With over 52,000 customers now in the network and revenue growing by 22% to reach $529.4 million, there is real potential here. Operating margins also improved to 19%, with cash flow stable at about $35 million. Most investors consider the AI revolution to continue well into the future, and with increased demand for data organization and integration, the firm could well be well positioned to benefit.
Nevertheless, I’m most concerned about the firm’s reliance on a single product. With so much focus on Atlas and an enormous amount of competition, having a usage-based model for revenue brings an added layer of uncertainty for investors.
While many companies have locked in customers for long-term service agreements, one mistake or change in market sentiment could see the platform drop in usage overnight. This is especially true in an economic environment where many companies are cutting IT budgets in response to a challenging dynamic.
Further adding to my bearish sentiment, company CFO and COO Michael Gordon recently announced his resignation, effective from January 2025. Gordon was a key player in the firm’s IPO and its efforts to scale. Many would say he has laid out the groundwork for MongoDB, building out the financial and cultural elements that took it to where it is today.
With the sector evolving quickly, the leadership team will have to ensure it moves in the right direction to progress its strategy. While Gordon will work as an advisor to ensure a smooth transition, management will need to ensure the new CFO is able to hit the ground running at a challenging time for the company and at a moment when the competition will be looking for any opportunity to seize market share. The 7.4% drop in the share price following the announcement reflects this concern from the market.
From my perspective, there are three key challenges that make me bearish on MDB Stock:
1. Profitability– With the firm forecast to not make a profit (on a GAAP basis) over the next three years at least, investors will need to be encouraged that the company is edging closer towards sustainability. However, with earnings growing at a slower pace than the wider sector, 12.6% compared to 14.8%, the company needs to watch that it is able to reach this point before competition is able to dominate.
2. Valuation– Investors may be concerned about the firm’s fairly premium valuation despite the recent sell-off. With profits unlikely to be seen any time soon, it may not take much for patient investors to look elsewhere. A basic discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation suggests the fair value of shares is at $178.15, a full 50% below the current price.
3. Volatility– As I noted, the company’s usage based model leads to uncertain revenues, leading to fairly erratic stock performance. I would like to see a more diversified strategy and more certainty for investors.
I’m nervous that competitors such as Oracle (ORCL) are moving quickly to seize market share across a range of sectors. With vast resources, a strong balance sheet, and a diverse product portfolio, there are plenty of companies that may be able to move in on the areas MongoDB currently specializes in.
The company has a solid $2.3 billion in cash, far outweighing the $1.2 billion in debt, but the market capitalization of $19 billion compared to Oracle’s $484 billion shows what type of competitors MongoDB will be up against in the coming years.
Still, Wall Street analysts seem to suggest that some major opportunities are ahead for the company. With a price target of $379.75 per share, these analysts are implying 50% upside potential from the current level.
However, I’m less optimistic at this level. With a fair degree of uncertainty following Michael Gordon’s departure and enormous competition in the sector, I would want to see more solid rates of growth in customer acquisition and revenues, along with a valuation that provides more margin for error.
See more MDB analyst ratings
Of course, there are risks to my bearish sentiment. To begin with, there is clearly a great product at the heart of the company. Recent partnerships with Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS and Microsoft (MSFT) indicate that MongoDB has an important role in the development of the AI ecosystem. Advanced features in these systems may be superior to other products out there, as recognized by the Technology Partner of the Year award in North America and by the launch of various university courses for the MongoDB platform.
If the firm can continue to build a meaningful presence in the sector and, most importantly, keep it amid rising competition, there may be some signs of profitability over the coming decade. With so much demand and growth possible across AI, if the platform can become an effective source of information, enabling further scaling and features, then there is plenty of potential.
However, for me, the company has a lot to do before I can see a path towards sustainable profits. In today’s environment, a good product is not enough. The share price needs to be sensibly valued, with a diverse and resilient range of revenue streams, and the scale of innovation needs to be backed up by a competitive advantage across the sector, especially when going up against companies with larger resources.
I see some promising signs for the company over the coming decade, but I would suggest that the risks currently outweigh the rewards for new investors. I’ll be staying on the sidelines and keeping an eye on MongoDB for less bearish times.
