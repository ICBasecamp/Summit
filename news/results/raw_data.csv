"Apple's iPhone Market Share Declines in China, Huawei and Xiaomi Gain Momentum in 2024: Counterpoint","Smartphone giant Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones, minus their highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features, failed to gain traction in China, paving the way for the country’s domestic players in 2024.
Counterpoint’s Tarun Pathak mentioned 2024 as a year of recovery and normalization after a difficult 2023.
Global smartphone sales grew 4% in 2024 after two consecutive years of annual declines, Counterpoint cites preliminary data. Smartphone sales marked a decade low in 2023.

Almost every market grew, led by Europe, China, and Latin America.
The iPhone captured an 18% market share in 2024, down from 19% in 2023.
However, Apple continued to grow in its non-core markets, like Latin America, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Needham’s Laura Martin expects iPhones to account for 89%-96% of Apple’s fiscal 2025 revenue.
Counterpoint’s Ivan Lam flagged a consumer pivot to Apple’s premium offering, helping to offset some of the declines. Lam pointed to the growing sell-through share of Pro series devices in markets like China.
Samsung Electronics Co (OTC:SSNLF) led with a market share of 19% in 2024, down from 20% in 2023, backed by demand for its S24 series and A-series product lines. The S24 series gained traction as the first phone positioned as an AI device and performed exceptionally in Western Europe and the USA.
Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) reported a 14% market share in 2024, up from 13% a year ago. Oppo and Vivo each captured an 8% market share in 2024.
Xiaomi grew fastest among the top five brands in 2024, backed by its premiumization and expansion activities.
Oppo ended the year with stronger momentum. Vivo emerged amongst the top five, led by strong performance in India and China.
The top five remained the same as in 2023 but lost some share to Huawei Technologies, Honor, and Motorola. Huawei has no plans to give any respite to its rivals, who are doling out discounts for the New Year on their premium models.
China targets expanding government-supported consumption subsidies to include smartphones and other electronics, which will likely benefit domestic brands like Huawei and Xiaomi.
While generative AI-capable smartphones remain limited to the premium segment, Counterpoint expects them to become a norm for mid-range devices. By 2028, Counterpoint expects nine out of ten smartphones priced above $250 to be Generative AI-capable.
In 2025, Counterpoint expects revenue growth to continue to outpace volume growth, with revenues growing 8%, compared to 4%.
Price Action: AAPL stock is down 0.54% at $230.83 at the last check on Monday.

"Apple CEO's Compensation Set to Rise $10 Million in 2024, Pending Shareholder Vote","A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows Apple (AAPL, Financials) CEO Tim Cook's total salary set to rise by $10 million for 2024, dependent on shareholder approval at the company's annual meeting next month.
Comprising a $3 million basic pay, a $6 million cash incentive program, and a $50 million target equity reward, the proposed package comes at $59 million overall. This shows a $10 million change in the equity component of the package from 2023. Cook's 2023 pay put him close to the bottom end of the benchmark range for similar CEOs, the People and Compensation Committee stated.
The committee underlined in the filing Cook's leadership in propelling Apple's expansion and success, stressing that the higher equity reward corresponds with long-term shareholder interests. Cook's basic pay has been the same since 2016.
Scheduled for Feb. 25, 2025, the annual meeting will include a vote on Cook's proposed pay as well as many shareholder resolutions. Important recommendations include a study on ethical artificial intelligence methods, a call to stop efforts toward diversity, equality, and inclusion, and a report on philanthropy. The board has advised voting against these proposals as it claims that current rules appropriately cover these areas.
Apple said that already, its AI-related policies provide openness on data privacy. Citing established governance systems and congruence with business aims, the corporation further justified its DEI projects and charity giving program.
Apple shares dropped 2% to $232.15 by 12:18 p.m. EST Monday, marking a decline of $4.70 from the previous close.

"Apple, Samsung smartphone shipments fall in fourth quarter as China competition bites, IDC says","(Reuters) - Smartphone shipments for Apple and Samsung declined in the fourth quarter globally, as they grapple with intense competition from Chinese companies including Xiaomi, according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) on Monday.
The global smartphone market rebounded strongly after two years of decline, with Chinese smartphone companies rapidly expanding their market share through aggressive growth in low-end devices and a strong focus on the domestic market.
""While we remain optimistic about continued growth in 2025, the threat of new and increased tariffs from the new US administration has elevated uncertainty across the industry,"" said Nabila Popal, senior research director for worldwide client devices at IDC.
Apple's global shipments fell by 4.1% to 76.9 million units in the fourth quarter, while Samsung's shipments dropped by 2.7% to 51.7 million units, as competition from Chinese companies such as Xiaomi, Oppo, and Honor intensified, IDC reported.
In 2024, the iPhone-maker topped the global smartphone market with 18.7% share, followed by Samsung at 18% and China's Xiaomi at 13.6%.
However, among the top five smartphone brands last year, Apple's shipments fell by 0.9% and Samsung's by 1.4%, while Xiaomi showed the fastest growth with a 15.4% increase in shipments.
Chinese mobile makers shipped 56% of the global smartphones in the fourth quarter, marking the highest combined volume ever in a quarter, as they expanded their footprint across Europe and Africa, boosted by their low-end and mid-range devices.
""Despite the continued growth across several regions, we have seen a decreased demand for foldables in the market, despite intensified promotions and marketing,"" said Anthony Scarsella, research director for client devices, IDC.
Smartphone makers have started shifting research & design spend away from foldable smartphones as consumer interest remains flat, Scarsella said.

Zuckerberg Criticizes Apple's Innovation and Practices on Joe Rogan Podcast,"In an interview on the ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, Meta Platforms (META, Financials) CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently questioned Apple's (AAPL, Financials) innovation and charged the business of using limited practices that impede competition.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.
During a conversation on the widely watched ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg voiced worries about Apple's attitude to innovation and business methods. Apple, recognized for its innovative release of the iPhone, he said has not shown any notable innovation lately.
Zuckerberg also spoke about Apple's financial situation, pointing out that the sales of the iPhone seem to have leveled off. Still, he said, Apple has maintained profitability by mostly depending on strategies like collecting commissions on App Store purchases and pushing the purchase of extra accessories.
The Meta head expressed criticism of Apple's environment, which he feels is meant to stifle competition. He underlined how Apple's own products, such AirPods, which allow their smooth operation with the iPhone while limiting equivalent compatibility for third-party devices, are enabled by its own communication protocols. Zuckerberg says this strategy stifles innovation and keeps rivals from providing workable alternatives.
He also questioned the company's rationale for these limitations, implying that its assertions of giving customer security and privacy might be a kind of justification for anti-competitive behaviors.
Zuckerberg also underlined how Apple's rules affect Meta's financial situation. More open interoperability within Apple's ecosystem, he said, could greatly boost Meta's profitability. He cited difficulties Meta had trying to combine Apple's proprietary technologies with its Ray-Ban smart eyewear.

Will Apple's Growing China Woes Derail the Stock's Momentum in 2025?,"Apple AAPL shares had a terrific trailing 12 months, driven by its improving prospects, courtesy of the launch of Apple Intelligence. Since Jun. 10, 2024, when the iPhone maker announced Apple Intelligence in its annual developers’ event named the Worldwide Developers Conference, its shares have jumped 29.6%.However, Apple lost some momentum in early 2025 due to growing woes in China, with the iPhone losing market share to China-based competitors like Xiaomi and Vivo, per the latest data from Counterpoint Research, as cited by Bloomberg. Globally, Apple’s 2024 iPhone shipment declined 2% from that reported in 2023 and trailed Samsung, which saw shipment growth of 1%. Xiaomi gained the most, with its 2024 shipments jumping 12% from 2023. Overall, global smartphone sales grew 4% year over year in 2024.Stiff competition from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi in China compelled Apple to offer rare discounts for its latest iPhone model between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7. However, the lack of Apple Intelligence in Mainland China is expected to hurt despite the discounts on high-end iPhones.

AAPL’s Services business is expected to drive top-line growth. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.Although Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s strong growth driver. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Services revenues grew 12% year over year to $24.97 billion and accounted for 26.3% of sales.The Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the U.A.E., Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ is noteworthy. The addition of Apple Intelligence is expected to boost user engagement, as it is designed to enhance user experience and productivity while prioritizing privacy across iPhone, iPad and Mac platforms. Apple Intelligence is now available for iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with device and Siri language set to U.S. English.Apple expects the December-end quarter’s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow in the low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, the company expects a double-digit growth rate similar to that reported in fiscal 2024.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $95.96 billion, suggesting growth of 5.74% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for earnings has been unchanged at $1.68 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 9.8% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Apple’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 5.05%.

Apple’s AI push with Apple Intelligence is noteworthy. However, it is still playing catch up with the likes of Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.Although the Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow, with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, we believe that the delay in Apple Intelligence’s launch in countries like China and India will hurt shares.Hence, we believe that Apple’s near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation.AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.
